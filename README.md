ðŸ¤– AI ChatBot with Python & TensorFlow

Artificial Intelligence is redefining humanâ€“machine interaction, and chatbots are one of the most impactful innovations in this space. They enable computers to converse with users naturally, automate tasks, and provide instant support across industries like healthcare, e-commerce, and customer service.

This repository, AI_ChatBot_Python, is a hands-on project where we build a contextual chatbot entirely with Python, TensorFlow, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Unlike ready-made platforms, this project shows you how to design and implement a chatbot from scratch, giving you a deeper understanding of the underlying AI concepts.

The chatbot uses deep learning with TensorFlow to classify intents, process natural language, and generate meaningful responses. By training the model on predefined intents and responses, the chatbot learns how to interact contextually, making the conversation flow more realistic and intelligent.
